## Features

 * Cross-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD and DragonflyBSD)
 * Supports multiple batteries in case your notebook have them 
 * It is free
 * Usually it just works!

`battop` is backed by a Rust crate [battery](https://crates.io/crates/battery)
which provides unified cross-platform information about system batteries.\
